SYDE192L Odometer
================

This was a first year, end of term, lab project for a digital systems course.

Simple arduino-based bycicle odometer, uses uart connection to display data, but can easily be modified to use an LCD display.

We wrote our own version of millis...because why not?

Your results may vary.
